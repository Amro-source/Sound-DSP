Audio processing 

1. Find a voice sample on the internet in wav format, download one or record 
your own as wav le. 
2. Load this voice sample into MATLAB/octave and plot the audio signal in 
the time domain and in the frequency domain 
3. Loudness control: increase the amplitude of all frequencies below 200Hz 
and above 5kHz by factor 2, 5 and 10. Plot the Fourier spectrum and the 
time domain signal and describe the subjective change. 
4. Take a voice sample of a person and shift the frequencies by factor two 
once up and once down. Plot again the Fourier spectrum of the voice 
sample before and after the shift. Compare the two spectra and identify 
the voice in it. 
5. Take a voice audio sample and square it in the time domain. Then transfer 
it to the frequency domain and remove the DC component. Transfer it 
back to the time domain and listen to it. Describe and explain what the 
squaring has done to the audio signal. Again, plot all the signals in the 
time and frequency domain. 
6. Transfer a voice sample into the frequency domain. Remove all com
ponents which amplitude are below a certain threshold. Use di
erent 
thersholds and compare the results (MP3 \light").
